# NetApp Ontap REST API Training Files

This repo contains all of the exercise files for the training

## Important Notes

- The `ansible0/` and `sample_pcl_scripts` directories are the files provided for the class
- The `exercises/` directory contains the files that I created during the class, either based on copies of another script in either the `ansible0/` or `sample_pcl_scripts/` directories, or from scratch
- Only some of the modules really had content that justified creating a module folder for it
- Some of the files and configs are copied from NetApp's [ansible workshop]("https://github.com/netapp-devops/ansible") repo
- Another repo to reference is [here]("https://github.com/nichoalasbernstein/netapp-python-restapi-course-examples")
